                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Premium Acacia Wood:</strong> This tray is made from high-quality Acacia wood, known for its natural grain and durability. Unlike cheaper wooden or bamboo trays, this has no added finishes, giving it a clean, natural wooden tone with just a slight scent of nature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Versatile Use:</strong> This set includes three stackable trays, perfect for serving a variety of foods like cheese, charcuterie, appetizers, snacks, and desserts. The collapsible rack makes it easy to store when not in use, and the tray can also be used as separate dinner trays for a more versatile dining setup.</li>

                            <li><strong>Easy Maintenance:</strong> After use, simply hand wash the trays with mild soap and cool water. They are not microwave or refrigerator-safe, but occasional use of mineral oil will help maintain the wood’s appearance.</li>
