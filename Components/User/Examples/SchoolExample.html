                    Hi Henri, I have an email from my kid's teacher about school supplies they will need this year. Can you read the email, identify the supplies needed, find good products that match them and let me review the cart before checkout? Here's the email: Subject: School Supplies for the Upcoming School Year
                    
                    Dear Mrs. Johnson,
                    I hope this message finds you well and that Emma is excited for the upcoming school year! As we prepare to begin the 3rd grade, I wanted to provide a list of school supplies Emma will need to bring to ensure she has the materials necessary for a successful start to the year.
                    
                    **3rd Grade School Supply List:**
                    - 1 sturdy backpack (no wheels, please)
                    - 2 packs of #2 pencils (preferably pre-sharpened)
                    - 1 box of 24 crayons
                    - 1 pack of washable markers
                    - 1 pair of child-safe scissors
                    - 2 large glue sticks
                    - 1 ruler (inches and centimeters)
                    - 2 pocket folders (any color)
                    - 1 wide-ruled notebook (70 pages)
                    - 1 pack of wide-ruled loose-leaf paper
                    - 1 box of tissues
                    - 1 hand sanitizer (small bottle)
                    - Headphones or earbuds for use with tablets/computers (in a labeled ziplock bag)
                    - Optional: 1 box of gallon-size Ziploc bags
            
                    We ask that all supplies be labeled with Emma's name to avoid confusion. If for any reason you are unable to provide these items, please let me know, and we will make accommodations to ensure that every student has what they need.
            
                    Thank you for your support! I look forward to a wonderful year of learning and growth in 3rd grade. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.
            
                    Best regards,
